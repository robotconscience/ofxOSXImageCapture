OF ImageCapture interface
=======================================
Notes
-----
* I'm pretty bad at writing Objective-C, so watch out for sketchy code
* Only works with cameras right now (scanners in the future maybe)
* Will work with any camera that works in Image Capture
* To use: 
 	- clone into of/addons
  	- open up an example, compile & run!
